	"Greetings! I was wondering if you could help me grade the following answer given by a student.\n\nI’ll first describe the question that was given to the student, and then give you the student’s answer, and the grading rubric.\n\nThe question given to the student was as follows: \"Give a single piece of text with up to {num_sentences_str} in the context of {topic}. This single piece of text should illustrate all of the following skills: {skills_str}.\"\n\nThe student's answer was: \"{student_answer}\"\n\nFor reference, here are the definitions for the skills:\n{skills_defs_and_examples_simple}\n\nUsing a rubric table format, please grade the student's answer with positive scoring. Each criterion is worth 1 point. The criteria are: {rubric_items}. The table should only have the following columns: 'Criteria', 'Points Earned'. In the 'Points Earned' column, please provide only numerical values with no additional formatting. Please introduce the table with 'Here's the grading table:' and please include a row for 'Total Points Earned' at the end of the table. Finally, please start your grading explanation with 'Explanation':"
