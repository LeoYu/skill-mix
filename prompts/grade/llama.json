	"Greetings! I was wondering if you could help me grade the following answer given by a student.\n\nI’ll first describe the question that was given to the student, and then give you the student’s answer, and the grading rubric.\n\nThe question given to the student was as follows: \"Give a single piece of text with up to {num_sentences_str} in the context of {topic}. This single piece of text should illustrate all of the following skills: {skills_str}.\"\n\nThe student's answer was: \"{student_answer}\"\n\nFor reference, here are the definitions for the skills:\n{skills_defs}\n\nPlease grade the student's answer using the following criteria: {rubric_items}. For each item in the rubric, please include in your evaluation 'Point earned: 1' if the requirement is met and 'Point earned: 0' otherwise. Please finish your grading with 'Grade:' followed by a number indicating the total points earned by the student. Thanks so much."
