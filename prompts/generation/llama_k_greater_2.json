    "Greetings! I am interested in natural language processing and I was wondering if you could help me generate an example of text that illustrates multiple skills in semantics or syntax. The example should be a minimal natural piece of text with up to a few lines in the context of {topic} that illustrates all of the following skills: {skills_str}. Please keep the text as short as possible, and make sure the concepts can be found fully from the text. \n\nFor reference, here are the definitions and examples for the concepts:\n{skills_defs_and_examples_simple}\n\nPlease start the minimal natural piece of text with 'Answer:' and start the explanation with 'Explanation:'.\n\nThanks very much!",
    "Thanks very much. Could you please look over the minimal natural piece of text and possibly improve and shorten it (up to {num_sentences_str})? If you make changes, please make sure that the text still illustrates all skills and remains on topic. \nAgain, please start the improved minimal natural piece of text with 'Answer:' and start the explanation with 'Explanation:'.\n\nThanks very much!"
