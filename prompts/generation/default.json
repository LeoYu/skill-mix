    "Greetings! I am interested in natural language processing and I was wondering if you could help me generate an example of text that illustrates multiple skills in semantics or syntax. The example should be a minimal natural piece of text with up to a few lines in the context of {topic} that illustrates all of the following skills: {skills_str}. Please keep the text as short as possible, and make sure the concepts can be found fully from the text. \n\nFor reference, here are the definitions and examples for the concepts:\n{skills_defs_and_examples_simple}\n\nPlease start the minimal natural piece of text with 'Answer:' and start the explanation with 'Explanation:'.\n\nThanks very much!",
    "Thanks very much. Could you please look over your answer and improve it? Please make sure that the new answer better illustrates all skills and remains on topic. On top of that, please also make sure the new answer only contains up to {num_sentences_str}. \nAgain, please start the improved minimal natural piece of text with 'Answer:' and start the explanation with 'Explanation:'.\n\nThanks very much!"
