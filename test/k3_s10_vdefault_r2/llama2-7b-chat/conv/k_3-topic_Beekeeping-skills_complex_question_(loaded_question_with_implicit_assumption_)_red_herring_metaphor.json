            "[INST]": "Greetings! I am interested in natural language processing and I was wondering if you could help me generate an example of text that illustrates multiple skills in semantics or syntax. The example should be a minimal natural piece of text with up to a few lines in the context of Beekeeping that illustrates all of the following skills: complex question (loaded question with implicit assumption ), red herring, metaphor. Please keep the text as short as possible, and make sure the concepts can be found fully from the text. \n\nFor reference, here are the definitions and examples for the concepts:\n**complex question (loaded question with implicit assumption )**: A question that is loaded with an implicit assumption. For example, \"Why are you lying to me?\" is a question that presupposes you are lying to me. Any answer you give will force you to agree you are lying.\n**red herring**: Introducing irrelevant points to detract attention from a question. For example, A member of the press asks the president why they voted to expand a welfare program. The president responds, \"The strength of America is the strength of its communities, and I am proud to make our communities better places.\"\n**metaphor**: a figure of speech that, for rhetorical effect, directly refers to one thing by mentioning another. For example, \"All the world\u2019s a stage, And all the men and women merely players\" is a metaphor because it\u2019s a comparison without using \"like\" or \"as.\"\n\nPlease start the minimal natural piece of text with 'Answer:' and start the explanation with 'Explanation:'.\n\nThanks very much!",

Here's an example of text that illustrates multiple skills in semantics or syntax, specifically complex question, red herring, and metaphor, all related to beekeeping:\n\nExplanation: This text is a minimal natural piece of text that demonstrates how these concepts can be applied in a context related to beekeeping.\n\n\"Answer: How's your beekeeping going? Are you seeing any issues with the bees?\"\n\nComplex question: The question \"How's your beekeeping going?\" presupposes that the speaker is aware of the person's beekeeping activities and is asking for an update. Any answer given will imply that the speaker already knows the person's beekeeping situation.\n\nRed herring: The speaker introduces the idea of bee issues to distract from the original question of beekeeping progress. For example, the speaker might follow up with \"Oh, and have you noticed any strange behavior from the bees lately? They could be indicating a potential problem.\"\n\nMetaphor: The speaker uses the metaphor of bees as players to describe the beekeeping activity. For instance, they might say, \"It's like the bees are performing a dance, and we're just along for the ride.\"\n\nExplanation of concepts:\n\n* Complex question: The question \"How's your beekeeping going?\" presupposes that the speaker is aware of the person's beekeeping activities and is asking for an update.
