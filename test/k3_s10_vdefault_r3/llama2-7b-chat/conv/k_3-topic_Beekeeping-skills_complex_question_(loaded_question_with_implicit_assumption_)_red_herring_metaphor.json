            "[INST]": "Greetings! I am interested in natural language processing and I was wondering if you could help me generate an example of text that illustrates multiple skills in semantics or syntax. The example should be a minimal natural piece of text with up to a few lines in the context of Beekeeping that illustrates all of the following skills: complex question (loaded question with implicit assumption ), red herring, metaphor. Please keep the text as short as possible, and make sure the concepts can be found fully from the text. \n\nFor reference, here are the definitions and examples for the concepts:\n**complex question (loaded question with implicit assumption )**: A question that is loaded with an implicit assumption. For example, \"Why are you lying to me?\" is a question that presupposes you are lying to me. Any answer you give will force you to agree you are lying.\n**red herring**: Introducing irrelevant points to detract attention from a question. For example, A member of the press asks the president why they voted to expand a welfare program. The president responds, \"The strength of America is the strength of its communities, and I am proud to make our communities better places.\"\n**metaphor**: a figure of speech that, for rhetorical effect, directly refers to one thing by mentioning another. For example, \"All the world\u2019s a stage, And all the men and women merely players\" is a metaphor because it\u2019s a comparison without using \"like\" or \"as.\"\n\nPlease start the minimal natural piece of text with 'Answer:' and start the explanation with 'Explanation:'.\n\nThanks very much!",
            "[/INST]": " Answer: \"The bees are restless, and the queen is nowhere to be found. What do you think might be causing this?\"\n\nExplanation: This text illustrates multiple skills in semantics and syntax, including complex questions, red herrings, and metaphors.\n\n* Complex question: The question \"What do you think might be causing this?\" is loaded with an implicit assumption that there is something unusual going on with the bees, as the speaker implies that the bees are not usually restless. Any answer given will force the listener to agree that there is something wrong with the bees.\n* Red herring: The mention of the missing queen is irrelevant to the question at hand (why the bees are restless) and is intended to distract the listener from the real issue.\n* Metaphor: The use of the phrase \"restless bees\" is a metaphor, as it directly refers to the bees without using \"like\" or \"as.\" The phrase creates a vivid image in the listener's mind and emphasizes the idea that the bees are not acting normally.\n\nOther possible examples of this text that illustrate the same concepts could be:\n\n* \"What do you think might be causing the bees to be so agitated?\" (Complex question, red herring, metaphor)\n* \"The bees are acting strangely, aren't they? (Complex question, red herring)\n* \"The queen is missing, and the bees are in an uproar. (Metaphor)\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
